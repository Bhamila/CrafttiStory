  <h1>About Me:</h1>
  Hello Everyone, I'm Bhamila, a software professional who is also curious about learning and doing crafts.
  I am fueled by my passion for exploring new crafty items. My hobbies are Painting, Dancing, and Playing badminton. 
  It's all from my Mom I have learned basic crafts like crochet, knitting. And later I have started with painting, clay 
  arts, resin arts, etc.
  The thing which amuses me more about handmade products is the ingredients we use. They mean no harm to us, no harm to whoever using it, and very importantly no harm to the earth. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Don't you hate it, when you have searched every nook in the mall/ online shopping websites to find a perfect gift for loved ones? But did not find anything amazing/interesting/useful? 
  Handmade products - big/small will hold tons of love and are the best when it comes to gift/decorative items where you give your valuable time and the gift always holds the love you had while making it, what else in this world you can give to your loved ones apart from TIME which means a lot, and on top of that you can customize the way you want Â - Whoa. That's crazy right. I must know more!
  My hunger for knowledge on crafts lead me here, I will be sharing my knowledge on what I have explored so far and, my forever learning.
  
  Let's take a deep dive into the craft world together! Welcome to CrafttiStory.
 </p>
 <p>
  P.S. Thanks to my Hubby and Friends for supporting me in doing this.
